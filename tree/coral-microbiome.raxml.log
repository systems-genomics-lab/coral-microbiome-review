RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 71 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 83 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file coral-microbiome.aln.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 2 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
